Baseball and Money – Project 1
As a group, we decided to use a dataset from Kaggle.com called Baseball Databank (https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank).  There are several CSV files including data on players, teams, salaries, and playoff games that enabled us to develop some interesting questions. These questions include:

1. For teams that make it to the playoffs, does high spending on player salaries mean they win more often?
2. Do “star players” make a big enough difference that they justify their contracts?
3. Do specific players make a noticeable difference when they change teams?

The data was merged, cleaned, and organized to allow for easier examination.  We began by noting how many times a team made it to a playoff game or world series game. In addition to their record, the team’s salary was recorded to see if there was a correlation between how much money a specific team spend and if they had a winning record. We chose to investigate further into four teams and their spending habits: the Oakland A’s, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, and St Louis Cardinals mainly because they were four very different teams with seemingly different spending strategies. The Yankees are known for having expensive taste. Oakland is notorious for its use of data analytics to get the most for their money. Detroit and St Louis are more middle of the road spenders, with some success in their playoff appearances. St Louis was actually the team with the most playoff games.
Finding answers to our questions was not straight forward.  There were two cases in which a “star player” switched teams and it coincided with a World Series appearance.  Obviously there are many other factors in play and limitations to what we can determine from this data. We conclude that money helps, but it is not the only factor that makes a team successful.

Powerpoint: Baseball and Money.pptx
file and is separated as such:
- first section, regarding winners and losers, and overal team performances during the 2005-2015 years - Kylie Malcolm
- Money Section, containing comparison of teams' Sum payrol vs Mean, for top 50% of teams as well as selected 4 teams (NYA, SLN, DET, OAK)  - Elena Erofeeva
- Players Section, containing research of individual players salaries - Kelly Olien
- Championship Series section, concerning appearances of teams in the championships other than World Series - Kory Harris (conclusions from this section ended up moving to the front of the power point and presentation)

Additionally:
we worked as a team drawing conclusions and formulating a hypothesis. Elena Erofeeva maintained the Git repo and worked on merging individual branches into the Main via NBDIME tool; Kory Harris and Kylie Malcolm provided invaluable understanding of the sport and the dynamics, as well as insights into limitations of our data source and what exact information was missing, Kylie Malcolm prepared and controlled the Powerpoint during the presentation, Kelly Olien worked on Readme and took notes during our discussing the process and hypothesis, and without her work our train of thought would have been lost.
